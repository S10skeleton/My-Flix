## Bonus I will try to implement

Although this is not a requirement for your project, see if you can also implement functionality to meet the minimum requirements of a PWA:

- Uses a web manifest

- Uses a service worker for offline functionality

- Downloadable movies files for offline use

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: git@github.com:S10skeleton/MyFlix-Shanes-P3.git

2. Install NPM packages:

3. Setup environment variables in `.env` file.

4. Build the site: 'npm run build'

5. Start the server: 'npm start'

## Usage

After starting the server, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` on your web browser to access the MyFlix application. You will obviously need to provite your own movie files
